# JOSDC-different-processers-architectures-


This repo contains the participation of our team in Jordan National Semiconductors Design Competition with 3 desings of 32-bits processer written in verilog:

1- Single cycle architecture.

2-Five stages pipeline with forwarding, stalls and correlating gshare branch prediction.

3-superscaler out of order architecture supporting integer operations, integer multiplication and floating point arethmatic with correlatin gshare branch prediction.

For additional info and design details please read Competition final Report teamlleh PHASE III.pdf which is contained in this repo.
